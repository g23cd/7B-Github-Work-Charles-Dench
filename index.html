    <h1>Dogs!</h1>
    <p>There are <b>many</b> different breeds of Dogs and each of them have different attitudes.</p>

    <h2>Games They Like To Play.</h2>
    <p>Most Dogs like to play with their owners and they can do it for ages, these games can vary from fetch to hide and seek (if you train the Dog well enough).
     <br> I have a Dog that really likes playig tug of war and fetch. Sometimes he even brings the toy back to me and throws it onto my lap.</p>
    <h3>Food They Eat.</h3>
    <p> The food that they eat can vary from special dog food for their age and size and there are also other things they an eat such aslean cooked meats
        (chicken, fish), certain fruits (apples, blueberries, watermelon without seeds/rind), vegetables (carrots, green beans, cucumber), cooked eggs, plain yogurt, and small amounts of cheese, 
        but always cooked, unseasoned, and free from toxic items like grapes, onions, garlic, chocolate.</p>
